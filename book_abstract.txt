19 La corte del Luigi XVI sta per essere travolta dallo scandalo del secolo, passato alla storia come "l'affare della collana". L'intrigo, ordito da una nobildonna decaduta, assetata di denaro e bramosa di scalare vertici dell'alta societa parigina e di avere un ruolo corte, coinvolge nelle sue trame l'ambizioso cardinale Rohan, il sedicente mago e alchimista Cagliostro, fidatissimo amico dell'alto prelato, e la stessa regina Maria Antonietta, spianando la strada alla Rivoluzione dell'89. L'affare della collana non resta confinato fra le mura dei tribunali, diventa subito di pubblico dominio. Le arringhe degli avvocati vanno ruba come bestseller, molti scrittori si arricchiscono con pamphlet scandalistici venduti migliaia di copie. La Francia si appassiona alla vicenda e si divide fra innocentisti e colpevolisti. Ma il debole Luigi non ne coglie appieno la portata e lascia che le cose seguano il loro corso, accelerando cosi il tramonto e la fine della monarchia francese.

8 Robles Martinez fue un escritor de mediano prestigio. Si bien pertenecia las ligas mayores de la literatura, estaba muy cerca del reconocimiento masivo que suponia su obra. La critica mas exigente lo resenaba como una futura promesa. Los comentaristas dominicales de libros siempre parecian estar punto de considerarlo como un escritor que necesitaba tarjetas de presentacion en el extranjero: su firma sus premios lo avalaban. Sin embargo, en los ultimos anos, un oscuro haz de luz parecio entorpecer su calidad de escritura. Los criticos senalaban que se habia convertido en un mero escritor deseoso de superventas, pergenando novelas simples facilonas que jamas podrian igualarlo sus admirados Faulkner Joyce. De forma sorpresiva, la prensa especializada decia que sus libros era un conjunto de acartonados personajes que seguian las lineas convencionales del realismo puro duro. "El secuestro de Robles Martinez" son dos novelas cortas agrupadas en un crimen, "El mayordomo" describe el modus operandi de una agrupacion de la alta sociedad hermetica cuyos fines son desconocidos inclusive para el mas leal de sus miembros, mientras que "El diario" es un palimpsesto del escritor secuestrado donde hace un analisis critico de sus origenes su porvenir. Dicha publicacion esta emparentada al cyberpunk la novela negra, rompiendo su vez todas las reglas pre-establecidas en dichos estilos literarios.
