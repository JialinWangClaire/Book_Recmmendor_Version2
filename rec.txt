Il messaggero e una sua personalissima reinvenzione letteraria, da cui Muhammad emerge tutta la sua umanita e modernita, un racconto che profuma di datteri e ulivi, e che parla del potere della parola e del mistero divino.

Konstantinos Paleologos'un (1405-1453), "Romalilarin Gercek Imparatoru Otokrati" seklindeki azametli emperyal elkaba sahip oldugunda devraldigi Konstantinopolis, yani bir zamanlarin Yeni Roma'si, bu ihtisami yansitmaktan hayli uzakti. Yil 1449'du. Tarihin doneminde dunyanin parcasinda yukselen guc olan Osmanlilar, hakimiyetlerini yayarken etrafindan gelip gectikleri kadim imparatorluklarin bu aciz bakiyesine gosterdikleri tahammulun sinirina varmislardi. Sehri dort yandan kusatan karadan ikmal yollarini kesen Turklere karsi Kontantinos'un denizden yardim alabilecegi tek yer olan Hiristiyan Bati ise kiliselerin birligi adi altinda kendi Katolik inancini hiyerarsisini dayatmaktaydi. En muhtac olduklari anda buyuk bir dinsel kargasa bolunme yasayan Konstantinopolis'in Ortodoks sakinlerinin elinde kalan yegane koruyucu, tarihi boyunca sehrin taliplerini durdurmayi basarmis olan guclu surlariydi. Nitekim surlarda gedik acildiginda sehir de dusecekti. Donemin kaynaklarina gore iyi egitim almis, becerikli, sabirli, vizyon sahibi insanlari idare etmesini bilen bir hukumdar olan XI. Konstantinos, henuz vakti varken kacip kurtulmasi yonundeki telkinlere tenezzul etmemis, sayi askeri teknoloji acisindan kat kat ustun Osmanlilara karsi sehri savunanlarin lideri olarak elinden gelen seyi yapmistir.

Mehmed, "Fatih" namiyla yucelirken, elinde kiliciyla veren Konstantinos da halki arasinda efsane mertebesine yukselmis, aslinda olmedigi, mermere donuserek uyudugu gunun birinde uyanip sehrini kurtaracagi inancina kaynaklik etmistir. Bizans uzmani Donald M. Nicol'un Atina'daki Gennadion Kutuphanesi muduru olarak calistigi donemde yazdigi elinizdeki biyografi, kisa talihsiz iktidari doneminde buyuk caresizlik icinde kivranan, bu durumdan kendini sehrini kurtarmak icin var gucuyle cabalayan sonunun geldigini anlayinca da bunu mertce karsilayan bir hukumdar portresi cizmektedir.

Ancak Nobel Odullu sair denemeci Brodsky'nin kalemi bakis acisi bu portreyi zeki, bilge, dokunakli tam anlamiyla zarif bir hale getiriyor. Brodsky bir flanor gibi Venedik'in caddelerinde, sokaklarinda, kanallarinda, su basmis kiliselerinde dehlizlere acilan eski yapilarinda dolaniyor; insanlari, mutfagi, tarihi, hatta giyim kusami hakkinda birbirinden ilginc bilgiler veriyor, tanik oldugu tuhaf anekdotlar anlatiyor. Bu su sehrinden unutulmaz kis manzaralari, sularin yukselmesiyle gelen olaganustu guzellikte goruntuler resmediyor. Boylece sehrin kiside uyandirdigi tuhaf, tekinsiz ama alabildigine siirsel imgelerin pesine dusup insanin suyla, dolayli olarak da onun yansimasi zaman guzellik kavramiyla ikircikli iliskisini irdeliyor - ama ancak bir sairin, hem de buyuk bir sairin yapabilecegi sekilde. Su Seviyesi, Venedik'i sularin kusatmasi gibi zamanin da insani kusattigi bir gerceklik resmediyor sakinmadan -- buna karsin "guzellik" veya "sevgi" gibi, zamani asmanin yollarini isaret ederek...
